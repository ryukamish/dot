Sxiv Configuration
==================

This directory consists of the configuration files of the program `sxiv` which is an image viewer with added
extra features which I love! Features I love about it are:
    1. Vim keybindings
    1. Output can be piped into sxiv
    1. Very friendly with scripts

Files
-----

The first file which it has is the [image-info](./exec/image-info) which
by the name gives you the information of the image you opened in sxiv
on the bottom left.
The second file is the [key-handler](./exec/key-handler), what is so great
about it? Well, you can run long commands with a *prefix* (CTRL+x) and with another
key just like in `emacs`. So, basically it handles the keybindings in sxiv
which is great!
