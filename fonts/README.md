Mono Spaced Fonts
=================

This directory only contains the fonts I want to be portable and to use in any system if those fonts are not available to the package manager and all that. No `bash` script required for this `fonts` directory.

The Mono Spaced Font Used
-------------------------

The font that this directory has is `IBM Plex Mono` font.
