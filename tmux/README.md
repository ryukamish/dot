# TMUX Configuration

TMUX is the most powerful multiplexer on the planet (after for few monthes made me feel like this). This is the coolest thing I have seen. Split the panes, have windows inside windows (wtf..??), Vim-like keybindins and a lot of customization to it.

- 100% `screen` muscle memory
- Vim-bindings for pane navigation and resizing

## Installation

Just to the [setup][`setup`] thingi and done. *BOOM!* we have our setup of tmux.
