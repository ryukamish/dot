# TMUX Configuration

TMUX is the most powerful multiplexer on the planet (after for few months made me feel like this). This is the coolest thing I have seen. Split the panes, have windows inside windows (wtf..??), Vim-like keybindings and a lot of customization to it.

- 100% `screen` muscle memory
- Vim-bindings for pane navigation and resizing

## Installation

Just do the [setup](./setup) thing and done. *BOOM!* we have our setup of `tmux`.

## Things to know

I have enabled `tmux` copy-mode to copy from the terminal. So, what it does is that it lets me copy text from the terminal output which makes errors and their solutions to find easy.

The keybinding to it is:
- ( `Prefix` + [ ) will go to copy-mode in (ofcourse) tmux.
