New Found Knowledge
-------------------

I found a new knowledge today (dated May 09 2022) that bash can debug a script without running it by giving the flags `-x` to bash and it will give a plus sign if the script runs fine and errors if not.
Also + and - to the `x` flag will evaluate a block of the script with negative being first and plus being later.
