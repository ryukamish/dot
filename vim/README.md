# Vim Configuration

## Installation

Symlinking to right place will make it more easier to maintain this repo in [`github`](https://github.com/ryukamish). Running the [`setup`](./setup) script will do the work and nothing needs to be done. It is suggested to read the script before running it, to make sure you are doing what needs to be done.

## About Colors

This also comes with a colorscheme `paramount` which is what I usually use with vim.
